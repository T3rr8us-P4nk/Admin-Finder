WINDOWS USERS.....

 Getting Started with Padre on Windows

1. Download Padre 0.45 from download the name of the file to be saved on the desktop is called padre-standalone-0.45.msi >> https://bit.ly/2RhkPdE

2. Run this installer by double clicking on the icon.

3. It will ask you to accept the terms. Once you did that you can press the Install button.

4. Once installation is finished you should be able to see the installed icons by pressing on "Start" then on "Programs" and then selecting "Padr
   Standalone".

5. The package you downloaded is the latest version packaged for Windows but there are newer versions of Padre on CPAN. You should now upgrade by
    doing the following: Click on "Start", "Run", copy the following command and press ENTER:
    perl -MCPAN -e "CPAN->upgrade('/^Padre/')"
    or maybe better with full path to the Perl executable (perl.exe):
    c:\strawberry\perl\bin\perl.exe -MCPAN -e "CPAN->upgrade('/^Padre/')"
    This will open a black window. You'll see text printed in that window while Padre is being upgraded. The process can take anywhere between 4-5
    minutes and 70 minutes depending on the speed of your Internet connection and the phase of the Moon.
    
6. Run Padre by clicking on "Start", selecting "Programs", selecting "Padre Standalone" and clicking on the "Padre" icon. (there will be two windows,
   a black console and the editor itself). This is considered a bug and it will be fixed in a future version.
   
7. Select "Plug-ins", "Plug-in Manager", you should see a list of plug-ins. Please make sure to enable the "Padre Developer Tools" plug-in and the
  "Padre Popularity Contest" plug-in as well.
    
8. Click on "Save"
